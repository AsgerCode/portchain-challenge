# Portchain Software Engineering Challenge

This project was developed as a challenge proposed as a part of the hiring process for a position as a Software Engineer at Portchain.

For the solution, I decided to make a simple node.js program that runs on the terminal and accomplishes the suggested tasks, in a way that is easy to visualize.
